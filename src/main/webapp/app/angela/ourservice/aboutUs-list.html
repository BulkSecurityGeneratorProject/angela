			                <p>Our founder Mr. Ray and co-founder Mr. Alex started their promo business in North California 15 years ago. They noted that with the global economy blooming, local industries in the US no longer prevail like before, lower material and labor cost has converted China into a manufacturing power. Everything seems to be made in China in the US market.</p>
			                <p>Mr. Ray came up with an idea, why not have our own Chinese division so that we can get more factory resources and lower the cost? Doing is better than saying, they spent tons of efforts travelling to China, planning, searching and negotiating with factories and local government. Finally, all tears and sweat paid off, our Chinese division settled in Suzhou, a promising city at the east coast of China, not far from Shanghai.</p>
