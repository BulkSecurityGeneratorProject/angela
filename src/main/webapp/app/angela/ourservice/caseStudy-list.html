	                <h4>Case study, Beer bottle.</h4>
	                <p>When the client reached out us and said they want a unique beer vessel for baseball events which can also works as a souvenir. </p>
	                <div class="service-pic"><img src="content/images/case-pic1.png" /></div>
	                <p>We searched all existing cups used for stadium beer sales, found most of them are often for one-time use and don’t have extinguishing features that leave lasting impressions.</p>
	                <div class="service-pic"><img src="content/images/case-pic2.png" /></div>
	                <p>Bearing these in mind, we started brainstorming and finally we nailed down on a baseball bat</p>
	                <p>shaped bottle idea, and we’d like to put team logo and wood texture on it to make it like a real bat. Actually we also found some wine bottles on the market look just like a pressed baseball bat and sometimes baseball bats look just like a long bottle.</p>

	                <p>Few hours later, the first hand sketch of our bat bottle came out. It looks gorgeous even after we pick up the right wood pattern and some random logo for it. Our client was excited on these bottles and wanted to develop a prototype for it after seeing our design.</p>
	                <div class="service-pic"><img src="content/images/case-pic5.png" /><img src="content/images/case-pic6.png" /></div>
	                <p>There is no existing example and no story we can refer to for this product. We decided to create our own by 3D modeling. After few trails and tests, the final bottle came to our hands. We took videos and send it to client immediately to let them know the news first because it takes few more days after we mail the prototype to them. We always want to be efficient.</p>
	                <div class="service-pic"><img src="content/images/case-pic7.png" /><img src="content/images/case-pic8.png" /></div>
	                <p>However, problems show up when we try to decide the printing method. The cost will be too high if we use water-transfer which will fail our client’s budget. Why not use heat shrinking wrap like the other bottles on the market? One of our team members just enlightened us with a seems-to-be-perfect proposal. We did the math and ensured the cost was under control.</p>
	                <p>But problem showed again when we try to heat shrink the wrap over the bottle. The bottle was designed to be PET plastic which can not stand the high heat in the wrap shrinking process. It just collapsed after entering the hot oven.</p>
	                <p>We like challenges and problems can never beat us. PET is not heat resistant but PP is! Just think about the micro-oven box and feeding bottle, they are all PP and heat resistant. We move to PP material and of course the result is just satisfying.</p>
	                <p>In order to provide more options for clients, we also offered one color printing and transparent bottle to fit for their budget.</p>
